# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of the project was to create a variety of filters that could be used to filter the ufo data by date, city, state, country, and shape, rather than just by date.


## Results
To use the new webpage, simply input the desired search criteria into the appropriate textboxes. Multiple search filters can be simultaneously applied to the data. Make sure not to mispell anything or use any punctuation or capital letters, as those will not work. After inputting the desired filter(s), it may be necessary to hit the Enter key or click outside the box in order for the filter to work.

## Summary
One large drawback of this design is that the user has no way of knowing if something if there without trying to filter first, and the search words have to match the text completely. The filter does not work if the capitalization does not match. 

### Potential Improvements
It might be nicer to have a dropdown menu instead of a textbox for a few of the filter searches. The shape filter in particular could benefit from a dropdown so the user does not have to guess what all of the shapes are. It would also be helpful to be able to sort each column into groups and in alphabetical order; that way, all of the similar shapes could be grouped, or all of the states could be grouped.
